# Library to interact with the RTC RV8523 using I2C and Arduino
Library written for Arduino to interact with the RTC RV8523 via I2C bus.
This library makes use of the great I2C library available in the following repository: https://github.com/rambo/I2C

Note: This library is in early phases of development. Any contribution to optimize the code is welcome
